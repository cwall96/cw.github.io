    "The growth of CPU clock speed (i.e., the speed at which a single chain\n",

    "## Types of Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "Large textbooks have been written on different approaches to\n",
    "parallelization but we will keep a tight focus on what\\'s most useful to\n",
    "us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will briefly review the two main kinds of parallelization commonly\n",
    "used in scientific computing and discuss their pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing means concurrent execution of multiple processes using\n",
    "more than one processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, a **process** is a chain of instructions (i.e., a\n",
    "program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing can be carried out on one machine with multiple CPUs or\n",
    "on a collection of machines connected by a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the latter case, the collection of machines is usually called a\n",
    "**cluster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, although\n",
    "the physical memory chip might be shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is similar to multiprocessing, except that, during\n",
    "execution, the threads all share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native Python struggles to implement multithreading due to some [legacy\n",
    "design features](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock).\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not a restriction for scientific libraries like NumPy and\n",
    "Numba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions imported from these libraries and JIT-compiled code run in low\n",
    "level execution environments where Python\\'s legacy restrictions don\\'t\n",
    "apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is more lightweight because most system and memory\n",
    "resources are shared by the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the fact that multiple threads all access a shared pool of\n",
    "memory is extremely convenient for numerical programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, multiprocessing is more flexible and can be\n",
    "distributed across clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the great majority of what we do in these lectures, multithreading\n",
    "will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implicit Multithreading in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you have already been using multithreading in your Python\n",
    "code, although you might not have realized it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We are, as usual, assuming that you are running the latest version of\n",
    "Anaconda Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because NumPy cleverly implements multithreading in a lot of its\n",

    "The same is true when `y**2` is calculated, and then `x**2 + y**2` and\n",
    "so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba avoids creating all these intermediate arrays by compiling one\n",
    "function that is specialized to the entire operation.\n",
    "\n",
